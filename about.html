<h3 style="text-align:center">About me<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></h3>
<p>When I was five years old, I remember collecting a lot of rocks: charcoal chippings, river pebbles, slabs of cement. I filled boxes with the stuff until my parents complained of the junk<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, asked me why I would bother with all these edges when they could just take me to the store and buy me the smoothest eggs you'd ever see.</p>

<p>The thing about eggs, though, is that they're too fragile. I didn't like how the shells would crumble underneath my fingers, no matter how little pressure I applied to the membrane. Maybe that's why I never took very good care of my fish. Something about the films over their eyes always unsettled me, a complacent blindness<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>that was too alien for me to comprehend at the time.</p>

<p>Of course, I've grown myopic over the years. I've accepted this as a symptom of growing up that is as inevitable as coughing into your elbow or falling in love<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>But sometimes I still dream of all those boxes filled with rocks<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>. When we moved, the boxes were confiscated along with most of my superfluous belongings. I'd like to think, however, that they still exist somewhere, intact. Lined up like rows of books upon a shelf, or maybe even boy-soldiers before their first exposure to war, just waiting for an earthquake to reclaim their contents, lost children finally returning to sea.</p>
