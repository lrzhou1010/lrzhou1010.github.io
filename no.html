<div id="body1"><h2>The number of people reporting being raped on their first date with someone they met on a dating app has risen six-fold in five years, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35513052" target="_blank">figures show.</a></h2></div>

<div id="body2"><h2>The <a href="http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/publications/670-emerging-new-threat-in-online-dating-initial-trends-in-internet-dating-initiated-serious-sexual-assaults/file" target="_blank">report</a> by the NCA's Serious Crime Analysis Section said the rise appeared to be the result of the increased popularity of online dating combined with "the behaviors and expectations fostered by an online environment."</h2></div>

<div id="body3"><h2>The NCA said early analysis indicated "a new type of sexual offender" had been created through the online dating phenomenon. "These offenders are less likely to have criminal convictions, but instead exploit the ease of access and arm-chair approach to dating websites," it said. "This is aided by potential victims not thinking of them as strangers, but someone they have got to know."</h2></div>

<div id="body5"><h2>"Time spent communicating online or money spent on travelling to meet or on the other person may foster expectations that the relationship will progress even more rapidly upon meeting, or may even create the attitude that an individual has a right to get what they want from that meeting," said the report.</h2></div>

<div id="body6"><h2>The people allegedly carrying out the rapes were different to other types of sexual offenders, said the NCA — for instance they are significantly less likely to have a previous criminal conviction.</h2></div>

<div id="body7"><h2>Martin Hewitt from the National Police Chief's Council said: "Regardless of the circumstances, sexual activity against your will is a crime."</h2></div>
