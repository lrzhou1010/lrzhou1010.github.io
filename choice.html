<h1>Part 2: Zynder</h1>
<p>Subject line: IMPORTANT-new business opportunity</p>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>

<p>I am writing about an opportunity that may be of interest to you. It is well known that in this day and age, online dating is quickly becoming the norm. More and more people are utilizing online platforms in order to discover and make life-long meaningful connections. The advent of popular apps like Tinder, for example, have led to a boom in the online mobile dating industry, with several competitors spawning in the wake of their success.</p>

<p>With this in mind, it is thus important for new entrepeneurs who wish to enter into this competitive space to distinguish their product from the rest. This is something that I and my business partners have thought about extensively. After months of ideating and iterating, doing market research and consulting focus groups, I am excited to announce the arrival of Zynder, a new kind of online mobile dating experience.</p>

<p>Unlike other online mobile dating apps which attempt to package the "real-life" dating experience within the restricting context of a mobile app with their limited character bios and carousel of perfectly-curated photos, Zynder offers an experience that is more streamlined, goal-orientated, and fun. We at Zynder realize that the boom in online dating does not lie in its success rate (according to <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/29/5-facts-about-online-dating/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center</a>, 1/3 of of people who have used online dating have never actually gone on a date with someone they met on these sites) but rather its addictiveness. That is not necessarily a critique of the current online dating space but rather an observation that can be capitalized on in order to maximize the opportunities that this presents.</p>

<p>Zynder thus draws upon the principles of psychological behaviorial study in order to create an environment that incentivizes users to play and to play for longer. It turns online dating into a game that can be won.</p>
